The Uniswap ecosystem is large and evolving, and building your own integration requires using official artefacts and up‑to‑date infrastructure. Here’s what you need for the three areas you asked about:

### 1. Uniswap token lists and logos

- **What’s needed:** a machine‑readable list of tokens (symbol, address, decimals, logo URI, etc.) plus actual image files. Uniswap’s front‑end relies on a community‑standard “token list” JSON and pulls logo images from open repositories rather than bundling them in the app.
- **Best source:** The Uniswap **Default Token List**. It’s maintained by Uniswap Labs and follows the token‑lists standard. Each entry includes a `logoURI` field pointing to either TrustWallet’s assets repo or CoinGecko’s CDN. Using this list means you can display thousands of tokens without curating them yourself. The list can be fetched at build‑time from unpkg or npm (e.g. `https://unpkg.com/@uniswap/default-token-list/build/uniswap-default.tokenlist.json`) .
- **Logos:** The list’s `logoURI` values point to either:

  - **TrustWallet Assets** – a GitHub repository (`trustwallet/assets`) that stores per‑chain folders with PNG logos. The Uniswap docs state that the official interfaces pull logos from this repo.
  - **CoinGecko CDN** – for some tokens the list uses direct links to CoinGecko image servers.

- **Task:** In your front‑end build process, fetch the Uniswap default token list, cache it, and serve the `logoURI` images via a proxy to avoid CORS issues. If you need custom tokens, add them to a private token list following the same schema and host the logo images in your own CDN or contribute them to TrustWallet’s assets repo.

### 2. Selecting an RPC provider for the trading orchestrator

Your execution engine needs reliable JSON‑RPC and WebSocket endpoints to call Uniswap’s `Quoter` and broadcast swaps. As of Aug‑2025 the top providers are:

| Provider                | Key strengths                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Evidence                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **QuickNode**           | Designed for low‑latency DeFi/trading workloads. They advertise “unparalleled latency, reliability and scalability” and claim that their API response times are on average **2.5× faster than competitors**. They support **75 chains across 120+ networks** and provide WebSocket, HTTP, gRPC, dedicated clusters, MEV/Gas add‑ons and on‑demand data backfills. Good choice when latency and multi‑chain coverage are primary concerns.                                                      | QuickNode’s product page shows they focus on speed, reliability and scale, with 75+ chains and response times 2.5× faster than competitors. |
| **Alchemy (Supernode)** | Offers intelligent request routing (“smart routing algorithms trained on trillions of global queries”) that deliver **up to 2.5× faster queries** and unlimited elastic throughput. Alchemy provides advanced developer tooling such as unlimited‑range `getLogs` (scans the whole chain 265× faster), shuffle‑sharding for tenant isolation, transaction simulation, webhooks, token APIs and gas managers. Best suited if you also need deep analytics and developer tooling beyond raw RPC. | Alchemy’s RPC API page highlights these performance and tooling features.                                                                   |
| **Infura**              | Long‑standing provider known for uptime and stability. Their Ethereum API supports HTTP and **WebSocket** access with a **99.9 % uptime guarantee**. Infura offers an “always online” microservice architecture and a developer dashboard with usage analytics. They also have **Infura Transactions (ITX)** for gas management and transaction relaying. Good if you prioritise reliability and simple pricing over advanced features.                                                        | Infura’s product page emphasises fast, high‑availability infrastructure and WebSocket support.                                              |

**Recommendation:** For a high‑frequency trading/execution platform, QuickNode’s low‑latency network and multi‑region WebSocket support make it attractive. If you also need advanced analytics (e.g. transaction simulation) and broader developer tooling, Alchemy’s Supernode could be a better fit. Infura remains a solid baseline choice for reliability. Evaluate request quotas and pricing based on your expected call volume (e.g. QuickNode’s free tier includes \~10M API credits/month, while Infura’s free plan allows \~100k requests/day).

### 3. Latest Uniswap quoting contracts (August 2025)

To calculate expected output before executing a swap, your planner should call Uniswap’s “Quoter” contracts:

- **Quoter (v1)** – address `0xb27308f9F90D607463bb33eA1BeBb41C27CE5AB6` on Ethereum mainnet. It implements functions like `quoteExactInputSingle` and can be used for quick, view‑only quote estimates.
- **QuoterV2** – address `0x61fFE014bA17989E743c5F6cB21bF9697530B21e` on Ethereum mainnet. It improves functionality (e.g. returns gas estimate) but still performs state updates and can revert; Uniswap suggests calling it off‑chain.
- **View‑only Quoter** – In 2024/25 Uniswap Labs introduced a **view‑only Quoter** (`view-quoter-v3`) that removes reverts and unused state updates. The same address is deployed across several chains, e.g. on Ethereum (chainId 1) and Arbitrum (chainId 42161) the address is `0x5e55c9e631fae526cd4b0526c4818d6e0a9ef0e3`. It’s used by Uniswap’s smart-order-router and is likely the preferred quoting contract going forward.

**Task:** Update your execution planner to point to these contracts depending on the chain:

- For Ethereum mainnet and Sepolia: use Quoter (`0xb27308…`) or QuoterV2 (`0x61ff…`) for compatibility; prefer the **view‑only Quoter** (`0x5e55…`) if you want the latest implementation.
- For Arbitrum and other supported chains, use the view‑only quoter addresses listed in the view‑quoter-v3 README (e.g., chainId 42161 uses `0x5e55…`).

When quoting, remember that the Uniswap docs caution that Quoter and QuoterV2 are not gas‑efficient and **should not be called on‑chain**—they are meant for off‑chain price estimation. Use them via your RPC provider and pass the output to the execution layer.
