# Strategy Execution Platform

A hybrid Python-Rust execution platform that serves as a comprehensive bridge between trading strategies and decentralized/centralized markets. The platform provides a standardized, protocol-driven interface for strategy deployment, execution, and management while abstracting the complexity of multi-venue trading, risk management, and settlement.

Built on a modern Python-first architecture with selective Rust optimization for performance-critical paths, the platform enables everything from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated autonomous agents and ML-driven strategies to operate seamlessly within the same high-performance infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Intent-Driven Protocol**: Strategies declare desired outcomes ("intents") rather than specific execution steps. The platform handles the complex logic of planning, routing, and executing trades.
- **Hybrid Performance**: Leverages Python for rapid development, strategy logic, and ML capabilities, while utilizing Rust (via PyO3) for performance-critical components like execution engines and low-latency data processing.
- **Event-Sourced Architecture**: All state changes are recorded as immutable events in a TimescaleDB event store, providing a complete, auditable history of the system and enabling time-travel debugging.
- **Multi-Venue & Multi-Chain**: An abstract `VenueAdapter` interface allows for seamless integration with various trading venues (AMMs, Order Books) across different blockchains.
- **Integrated Risk Management**: A protocol-level risk engine evaluates intents against predefined risk boundaries and portfolio metrics before execution.
- **Agent & ML-Native**: Designed with first-class support for autonomous agents and ML-driven strategies, including integration with ONNX for model inference and Ray.io for distributed processing.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Core components are instrumented with Prometheus metrics for robust monitoring of intents, strategies, and system health.

## System Architecture

The platform operates on a layered architecture that separates strategy logic from execution complexity.

1.  **Strategy Layer (Python)**: Strategies are self-contained Python objects that generate `Intents`. They interact with the platform via a standardized API and event streams.
2.  **API Layer (FastAPI)**: A high-performance FastAPI server provides endpoints for submitting intents, managing strategies, and querying system state.
3.  **Core Services (Python)**:
    - **Intent Manager**: Validates, prioritizes, and stores intents, creating a formal event-sourced record of every request.
    - **Execution Planner**: Decomposes intents into concrete execution steps, optimizes routing across venues, and simulates outcomes before execution.
    - **Venue Manager**: Manages connections to various trading venues through a standardized adapter interface.
    - **State Coordinator**: Manages the platform's state via an event-sourcing model.
4.  **Performance-Critical Layer (Rust)**: Rust modules, exposed to Python via PyO3, handle computationally intensive tasks such as transaction decoding, route optimization, and high-frequency data aggregation.
5.  **Data & Messaging**:
    - **TimescaleDB**: Used as the primary event store.
    - **NATS / Redis**: Used for real-time event streaming and caching (as defined in `docker-compose.yml`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **Rust Toolchain**: Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **uv**: The project's Python package manager. Install via `pipx install uv`.
- **Docker**: For running the local development infrastructure (TimescaleDB, etc.).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd platform-py
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Create a Python virtual environment and install the project, which includes all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install .
```

### 3. Start Local Infrastructure

The platform requires several services to run locally, including TimescaleDB, Redis, NATS, and a Ray cluster. The provided `Makefile` simplifies this process.

```bash
make docker-up
```

This command will start all required services in the background using Docker.

### 4. Set Up the Database

Once the database container is running, apply the schema to create the `events` table. The credentials and database name are defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
psql "postgres://platform:platform_secure_pass@localhost:5432/platform_events" -f deployment/schema.sql
```

### 5. Build the Rust Extension

Compile the Rust modules into a Python extension using `maturin`.

```bash
maturin develop
```

### 6. Run the Platform

Start the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`.

```bash
uvicorn platform.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The API is now available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can view the interactive OpenAPI documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Usage Example: Submitting an Intent

You can interact with the platform by submitting an `Intent` to the API. Here is an example of acquiring 0.1 WETH.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/intents/submit \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d
  {
    "id": "a3a2e9a8-1b3c-4d5e-8f6a-7b8c9d0e1f2a",
    "strategy_id": "c7b6a5e4-3d2c-1b0a-9f8e-7d6c5b4a3e2d",
    "type": "ACQUIRE",
    "assets": [{
      "asset": {
        "symbol": "WETH",
        "address": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
        "decimals": 18,
        "chain_id": 1
      },
      "amount": "100000000000000000",
      "percentage": 1.0
    }],
    "constraints": {
      "max_slippage": 0.005,
      "time_window_ms": 60000,
      "execution_style": "ADAPTIVE"
    }
  }
```

You will receive an `IntentReceipt` confirming that your intent has been accepted and queued for processing.
